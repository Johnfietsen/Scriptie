degree of connectivity:
	number of edges of node

in & out degree:					!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! average van sector, in bakjes
	amount of in and out links

weighted graph:						!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! input van NE oplossing
	weight given to links

adjacency matrix:
	matrix representation of connections

walk:
	sequence of adjacent vertices where repetition is allowed

path:
	walk without revisiting nodes

geodesic:						!!!!!!???????????
	shortest path between two nodes on a graph

centrality:						!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?
	measure of importance of a node

node's significance:					!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?
	measure of how critical the node is to the flow


LOCAL METRICS

degree connectivity 2:
	number of nodes it is connected to vs the total it could possibly be connected to

closeness centrality:					!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	measurement of the node's capacity to effect all other elements in the network

betweeness centrality:					!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	vertices that have high probability of occuring on a randomly chosen shortest path
	
prestige centrality:					!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	eigenvector centrality, assign relatives scores to important nodes


GLOBAL METRICS

network topology:
	overall patterns that emerge from network

connectivity:						!!!!!!!!!!!!???????????????
	density of the connections in the system

scale:
	number of nodes (sometimes more is not just more, but different)

clustering:
	forming of subsystems


NUMBER OF CONNECTIONS IS NOT JUST A QUANTITATIVE CHANGE, BUT ALSO QUALITATIVE

coupling parameter:
	difficulty of two nodes to connect

ease of interaction:
	the circumstances under which nodes are likely to interact

density:						!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	number of edges / number of possible edges

!!! FASE TRANSISTIONS !!!

diameter:
	the longest of all the geodesics (shortest paths)

average path length:
	shortest path between all pairs, adding up and dividing by total number

linear and exponential progression

connected:
	every node is reachable by other nodes

clustering:
	a sub-set in a graph that posses certain common characteristics or relate

homophily:
	interaction with similar nodes requires less resources

degree distribution:
	overall degree of connectedness to a network as a primary parameter
